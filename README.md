Be sure to check out their work!

To use, open generator.html in your browser. (You might need to enable javascript)

The generator will output a savefile named ffx_001, which you will need to rename into ffx_Y with Y being a 3-digit number between 001 and 099.

This savefile needs to be moved into the following directory:

Documents/SQUARE ENIX/FINAL FANTASY X&X-2 HD Remaster/FINAL FANTASY X/ffx_Y

Be careful not to accidently overwrite your already existing savefiles!!!

Changed some stuff from the original randomizer:

You now cannot choose to opt out for stat randomization, but you can now choose between shufflizing 

(like the original randomizer did) or randomizing stats.

  -Choosing to Randomize will result in every possbile stat being scattered across the sphere grid with the same weight.

You have the following options for ability-randomization:

  -None (Abilites arenÂ´t randomized)

  -Shuffle (Abilities are in the same spots, but shufflized)

  -Scatter (Abilities are in random positions on the grid)

You now have the option to start the game from the Al Bhed ship after meeting Rikku

  -Chests in Baaj are collected, Klikk is overkilled, no grenades are used

  -Remember to pick up the AL Bhed Primer on the ship if you want to!

You now have the option to shufflize each base stats across all characters.

  -This means that for example the base strengths of all characters get redistributed among them.

You now have the option to randomize the starting position of each character on the sphere grid.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some important information to keep in mind when choosing your randomizing mode:

If you choose to randomize the grid stats instead of shufflizing them, you will end up with a LOT more luck nodes than usual and a LOT less HP nodes than usual.

This happens because HP is usually by far the most present and luck the least present stat.

However, they now get randomized with the same weight, meaning they will have roughly the same presence.

(This is true for each single stat)

If you choose to shufflize character base stats, keep in mind that you can have for a example a very weak Tidus, which can make the early game very difficult. 

Worst case he can end up with 360 HP, 5 Strength and so on.

If you choose to randomize the grid starting position of the characters, they may end up on a lock or behind a lot of locks.

Even if the characters starts right on a lock-node (which cannot usually happen) you will need a key-sphere to break the lock the character is standing on, in order to move on.
