Original Code source: https://github.com/BitPatty/FFXRandomizer

Changed some stuff from the original randomizer:

You are now forced to shufflize stats, but are also able to choose to completely randomize them.
You have the following options for abilitie-randomization:

-None (Abilites arenÂ´t randomized)

-Shuffle (Abilities are in the same spots, but shufflized)

-Scatter (Abilities are in random positions on the grid)
