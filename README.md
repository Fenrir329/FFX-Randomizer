Original Code source: https://github.com/BitPatty/FFXRandomizer

Changed some stuff from the original randomizer:

You now cannot choose to opt out for stat randomization, but you can now choose between shufflizing (like the original randomizer did) or randomizing stats.

  -Choosing to Randomize will result in every possbile stat being scattered across the sphere grid with the same weight.

  -(This means that there will be a lot of luck nodes and a loss less HP nodes for example)

You have the following options for ability-randomization:

  -None (Abilites arenÂ´t randomized)

  -Shuffle (Abilities are in the same spots, but shufflized)

  -Scatter (Abilities are in random positions on the grid)

You now have the option to start the game from the Al Bhed ship after meeting Rikku

  -Chests in Baaj are collected, Klikk is overkilled, no grenades are used

  -Remember to pick up the AL Bhed Primer on the ship if you want to!
